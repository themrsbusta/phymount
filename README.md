Phymount 1.01 📸
Phymount is a lightweight, high-performance grid montage tool built with Python. Designed for speed and precision, it allows users to organize multiple photos into a single high-resolution grid without the need for complex editing software.

✨ What's New in v1.01
Adaptive Grid: Dynamic layout that responds to window resizing, drag-and-drop actions, and manual adjustments on the fly.

Enhanced Export: Fixed saving issues for .JPG and .PNG formats, ensuring stable and high-quality output.

Cleaner Launch: Removed unnecessary startup windows for a more direct and faster user experience.

✨ Key Features
Smart Multi-Drop: Drag and drop a batch of photos (e.g., 6, 12, or more) directly into the app. It automatically populates empty slots in order.

Intuitive Controls:

Left Click + Drag: Pan and frame your photo within the slot.

Right Click + Drag: Swap photos between slots instantly (Reorganization mode).

Mouse Wheel: Smooth real-time Zoom in/out.

Professional Output: Export your montage in HD (720p), Full HD (1080p), or 4K (Ultra).

Edge Clamping: Intelligent logic ensures photos never "leak" or show the background, keeping your grid perfect.

🚀 How to Use
Launch Phymount: Open the executable (now starts directly into the workspace).

Define Grid: Set your columns and lines; the grid now adapts as you resize or drag elements.

Import Photos: Drag your files from any folder into the grid.

Adjust: Use the left button to center, right button to swap positions, and scroll to zoom.

Export: Select the resolution at the top bar and click SAVE (fully compatible with JPG/PNG).
